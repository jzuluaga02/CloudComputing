5. How would you pass different arguments to the functions?
R/= I would have to modify the amount of arguments that the function receives or I could also use -d as a way to pass different arguments. 

6. How would you change the slack-interactive function to react to different inputs? 

R/= I would modify the function in manage.py so that it receives arguments of a different type, not only JSON and I would return a different
data type. Also, it would be neccesary to specify in the .yml file the type of data that we were going to work with, for example normal strings.
